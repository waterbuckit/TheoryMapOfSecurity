1,National,"National security logic is a traditional, state-centred conception of security. It is negative: security perceived as the absence of external threat to the national/state territory. Negative Security 'relates to the treatment of security as a concept we wish to avoid, one that should be invoked as little as possible. We value it negatively, or it is understood to represent a negative value' (Gjorv, 2012). Can be understood as 'security from' (a threat). 'Negative peace is reactive in nature as it seeks the cessation of actual or impending conflict' (Barnett, 2001, p.4), and it discurse is very often tied to this. National security logic is closely allied to military security logic, both historically and politically.","Classical security logic. The logic is one of exclusion which depends upon an understanding of self and other that is inextricably linked with territory. The 'security model is parsimonious' (Sagan, 1997). This is a logic of dualisms: challenge-resistance, defense-escalation, and recognition-
defeat (Doty, 1998, p.80). In contrast, a Positive Security Logic is perceived as 'something that is positively valued, or as something that is good or desired. It is a good which provides the foundation to allow us to pursue our needs and interests and enjoy a full life' (Gjorv, 2012). Can be understood as 'freedom to' or the 'security to', or 'enabling.'

Also, regarding the interoperation of National and Human Security Logics, in October 1993 Alexander Watson, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs suggested that the United States has vital interests in Haiti, including the following list of aims: 'the protection of the lives of approximately 10,000 American citizens, nearly 9,000 of whom are dual nationals, and 1,000 of whom are U.S. citizens only; to prevent the outflow of thousands of boat people to the United States from Haiti, many of whom would die in the attempt to flee; to reinforce political stability in a country which shares its small island with the Dominican Republic; a country which is itself struggling to preserve democratic practices; to fulfill the Governor's Island Agreement restoring civilian elected government to Haiti; and ending wanton violence which is destroying the fabric of Haitian society; to comply with the mandatory UN Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions on Haiti; to honor the U.S. and hemispheric commitment to democracy and the protection of human rights, and to discourage other violent challenges to civilian governments in the region; and to enhance U.S. influence and credibility internationally by demonstrating U.S. resolve in a region with strong historical, cultural, economic, and political ties to the United States'; excerpt from, Briefing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives, 103rd Congress, 1st Session, 20 October 1993.","Roxanne Lynn Doty, Immigration and the politics of security.

2,Military,"Military Security Logic represents 'the logic of war, which in its extended sense ('altogether') means to stop using the security act amongst ourselves. In war we do not have to discuss with the other, we can eliminate him. We do not move out into the political space between us; pure, self-based power politics rests solely on what we can do ourselves' (Weaver,  p.127).","Doty: 'it becomes impossible within this framework to imagine a kind of security that does not depend upon a particular understanding of danger, and a particular understanding of self and other, that is, danger stemming from another that is disruptive or at least potentially disruptive of the self's state or the self's society, thus evoking a certain kind of policy that is consistent with the logic of security' (Doty, 1998, p.80). Moreover, if assimilation is a relevant, it is 'driven by a logic of inclusion, albeit one that is coupled with exclusion in that the ''other'' is seen as an imperfect version of one's self which needs to be assimilated' (p.81). Likewise in the national security logic discourse security is often discussed in terms of 'the game', a metaphor which makes it hard to admit other security logics.",Networked armed forces (military networks) of the nation/state.,"Realpolitik, civil defence, homeland security, sovereignty.","Military procurement processes, including nuclear weaponry.

3,Societal,"Zooming in on the nation, another security logic emerges, that of society. 'Definitionally, societal security is about large, self-sustaining identity groups; what these are empirically varies in both time and place' (Buzan et al, 1988, p.119). Societal security logic is closely related to but is distinct from political or state-based security logic- which deals with the organisational stability of the nation, systems of government, and ideologies that give governments their legitimacy.","There can therefore be no solution in movements or campaigns for societal security... The nation is a circular reference to an empty place' (Weaver, 1996, p.115). Societal Security Logic has 'a tendency to reify societies as independent social agents, a use of too vague a definition of 'identity', and a failure to demonstrate sufficiently that social security matters to individuals' (Theiler, Tobias. Societal security and social psychology. Review of International Studies 29.2 (2003): 249-268).  Societal Security Logic deals with concepts of inclusion and exclusion, with conceptions of the self and of the 'other' closely linked to territory. The use of the concept of assimilation is 'driven by a logic of inclusion, albeit one that is coupled with exclusion in that the 'other' is seen as an imperfect version of one's self which needs to be assimilated' (Doty, 1998, p.81).

'Turks and Kurds of Turkey are not the citizens of two inimical states. They are members of the same state. The root cause of the existing conflict is not the two parties/communities, but the official institutions, practices, and ideology... Freeing the cultural domain from intervention by the political institutions... preserves political equality. This condition must be met if 'pluralist nationhood' is to be cultivated. Reductionist nationalism based on the ethnic identity and religious creed of a majority or of a privileged minority cannot ensure stability. It carries, in itself, the seeds of exclusion and segregation.'

4,Human,"Human security is a human and individual-centred conception of security. It is positive: security perceived as a desired good which enables the pursuit and enjoyment of a good life. It is a logic of inclusion, which transcends state boundaries and binary conceptions of identity. This logic is a mode of securitisation based on the welfare and dignity of human beings, 'security of people, not just territory, security of individuals, not just of nations, security through development, not through arms'. Human security logic 'requires a rethinking of the very notion of identity. Human security allows for a security that would not be guided by the idea of a fully constituted nation-state or society or a fully constituted exemplary self... [and] redefines the relationship between self and other and in the process modifies the very identity of self and other. It opens up cultural space through which the other may consolidate itself into something which is unaffected by negative cultural markings' (Doty, p.82).","A security logic not depending on territory for its credibility. Pluralism and inclusion are central to human security logic. Human security logic is inclusionary: 'the logic of human security... focuses on the security of people as human beings. Their link with national territory is not a defining or necessary feature... Difference is appreciated but not reduced to a superior-inferior, us-them kind of logic. The ""other"" is not reduced to a lesser and potentially assimilable self' (Doty, p.80-1). It concerns the individual but also 'the well-being of collectives along various dimensions not included in traditional understandings ofnational security or societal security' (p.82).","The welfare and dignity of human beings, whether citizens of states or otherwise.",Radical pluralism.,"Technologies designed to combat Hackers of all kinds, Malware and network disruption.",1,0,0,"National, Military",Planetary & Environmental,"The name of the U.S. occupation operation that landed U.S. forces in Haiti on 19 September 1994, 'Operation Uphold Democracy,' conveys the importance of a logic other than that of realpolitik. Haiti demonstrates that in fact issues related to human needs or human security can have a very real effect on security as traditionally understood. UN Security Council passed Resolution 940 on 31 July 1994, authorizing member states to form a multinational force under unified command to facilitate the departure of the military leadership consistent with the Governor's Island Agreement. 16,000 troops, most of them from the United States, moved into Haiti. Aristide was restored to power and the coup leaders left the country.","Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, and Carol Messineo, Human Security: A critical review of the literature.

5,Planetary & Environmental,"Environmental security is about relationships between human activity and the planetary biosphere. This looks, for example, at the impacts of underdevelopment, pollution, ecology, water, population, conflict and war and proposes a new theory of security on this basis. The United nations Conference on the Human Environment 1972 initiated a discourse on planetary security that has centred on 'epistemic communities, social movements, governmental departments, and international organisations' (Buzan et al, 1998, p.71).","In one commentary, this logic has a tendency to link environmental degradation and national security. This logic sets out to 'harness the emotive power of nationalism to help mobilise environmental awareness and action and may prove counterproductive by undermining globalist political sensibility' (Deudney, Daniel, The case against linking environmental degradation and national security. Millennium 19, no. 3 (1990), p.461).",Environmental security is about relationships between human activity and the planetary biosphere.,"Green politics, sustainability and developement politics.",Sustainable technologies.,1,0,0,National,Human,"In 2004 David King, then UK government's chief scientific adviser, claimed that climate change was a far more serious threat than international terrorism.
