It is negative: security perceived as the absence of external threat to the national/state territory. Negative Security \'relates to the treatment of security as a concept we wish to avoid, one that should be invoked as little as possible. We value it negatively, or it is understood to represent a negative value\' (Gj�rv, 2012). Can be understood as \'security from\' (a threat). \'Negative peace is reactive in nature as it seeks the cessation of actual or impending conflict\' (Barnett, 2001, p.4), and it discurse is very often tied to this. National security logic is closely allied to military security logic, both historically and politically.','Classical security logic. The logic is one of exclusion which depends upon an understanding of self and other that is inextricably linked with territory. The \'security model is parsimonious\' (Sagan, 1997). This is a logic of dualisms: challenge-resistance, defense-escalation, and recognition-defeat (Doty.1998, p.80). In contrast, a Positive Security Logic is perceived as \'something that is positively valued, or as something that is good or desired. It is a good which provides the foundation to allow us to pursue our needs and interests and enjoy a full life\' (Gj�rv, 2012). Can be understood as \'freedom to\' or the \'security to\', or \'enabling.\'','The state in relation to other states; critical information structures; the \'functioning\' of society.','Realpolitik, civil defence, homeland security.','Networked armed forces (military networks) of the nation/state.

Also, Doty: \'the national security implications of a porous U.S. border\'; \'The recent overwhelming focus on reinforcing the US-Mexico border is an example of a hyper-realist policy orientation\' (p.76). Re; the interoperation of National and Human Security Logics: In October 1993 Alexander Watson, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs suggested that The United States has vital interests in Haiti.\" These vital interests included \"the protection of the lives of approximately 10,000 American citizens, nearly 9,000 of whom are dual nationals, and 1,000 of whom are U.S. citizens only; to prevent the outflow of thousands of boat people to the United States from Haiti, many of whom would die in the attempt to flee; to reinforce political stability in a country which shares its small island with the Dominican Republic; a country which is itself struggling to preserve democratic practices; to fulfill the Governor\'s Island Agreement restoring civilian elected government to Haiti; and ending wanton violence which is destroying the fabric of Haitian society; to comply with the mandatory UN Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions on Haiti; to honor the U.S. and hemispheric commitment to democracy and the protection of human rights, and to discourage other violent challenges to civilian governments in the region; and to enhance U.S. influence and credibility internationally by demonstrating U.S. resolve in a region with strong historical, cultural, economic, and political ties to the United States\' \"Briefing before the Committee on Foreign Affairs,\" House of Representatives, 103rd Congress., 1st Session., 20 October 1993, 2.','Doty, Roxanne Lynn.

In war we do not have to discuss with the other, we can eliminate him. We do not move out into the political space between us; pure, self-based power politics rests solely on what we can do ourselves\' (Waever, p.127).','Doty: \'it becomes impossible within this framework to imagine a kind of security that does not depend upon a particular understanding of danger, and a particular understanding of self and other, that is, danger stemming from another that is disruptive or at least potentially disruptive of the self\'s state or the self\'s society, thus evoking a certain kind of policy that is consistent with the logic of security\' (Doty, 1998, p.80).

This view is most neatly captured in Alexander Wendt\'s seminal 1992 article, \'Anarchy is What States Make of it\'. This meaning is not (and cannot be) a simple reflection of an external material reality, but is developed through intersubjective interaction in the international system; several particular cultures of anarchy, rather than a timeless reality. The security dilemma is not inevitable, but is itself a social construction.','Security is a site of negotiation (between political leaders and domestic audiences in particular) and contestation (between different actors elaborating different visions of \'our\' values and how \'we\' should act). \'Regional security complex\': a set of units in a particular geographical area whose security processes and dynamics are interlinked to the extent that their security problems need to be understood or addressed in conjunction with each other. Security complexes are defined in terms of mutually exclusive geographic regions, with Regions and Powers focusing on security interaction and dynamics in Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East and Africa (Buzan et al. 1998: 201, Buzan and W_ver 2003: 44).','The state, and other groups if desired, but the state is priveleged in the framework: \'at the heart of the (security) concept we still find something to do with defence and the state\' (Weaver 1995: 47). Broadening of the definition of security to include concerns such as environmental change, poverty and human rights on state security agendas. Generally encourage different definitions of referent object.','Agents and structures are mutually constituted; state political leaders designate other states as \'friend\' or \'enemy\' - and approach them as such - on the basis of conceptions of identity (see Hopf, 1998). Critical constructivists look at \'how possible\' questions: \'how meanings are produced and attached to various social subjects/objects, thus constituting particular interpretive dispositions which create certain possibilities and preclude others\' (Doty 1993: 298).','Any actor that is said to represent an `existential threat\' to the referent.','The designation of threat occurring because of theadoption of a particular perspective on security: conceptions of who we are and what we value encourage particular ways of thinking.','Associated with the development of norms for global governance and the role of ideational factors in world politics generally; commitment to avoiding universal and abstract analytical definitions of security.

Facilitating conditions: particular contexts (including the form of the speech act; position of the speaker; and historical conditions associated with threat) that enable the acceptance of a particular securitizing move by the relevant audience. Constructivist approaches are able to come to terms with periods of structural change enabled by strategic actors in world politics; most prominently the end of the Cold War.','Nicholas Onuf\'s World of Our Making.',1989,'Lene Hansen (2000) suggests that the Copenhagen School\'s ultimate focus on \'dominant voices\' contributes to further silencing those already marginalized from security debates. The Copenhagen School\'s expressed preference for desecuritization - the removal of issues from the realm of security - is a product of a narrow view of the logic of security that has important normative implications. In their framework, a further area of bias is arguably that towards the \'West\', and ultimately neoliberal democratic forms of government. Also, the role of audience reception remains underdeveloped- see Christoph Meyer argues that securitization theory does not adequately address \'different levels of risk perception and fear among different types of audiences.\' p.660.

Berenice Fisher & Joan Tronto (1990) suggest that the use of social media can be a part of caring activities. Analysis of gendered categories is required in the application of reasoning.  The household has become increasingly separated from the sites of economy since the 18th century, with implications for the moral and caring roles that have been assigned men and women.','From this perspective, sharing and supporting through social media is one means of giving and receiving care. \'\'A high school teacher told me that she can tell the quality of a school she has entered within 10 minutes of being in the building. \"How?\" I asked. \"Oh\", she replied, \"you can just tell which buildings have caring principals and teachers.\" ','A complex, life-sustaining web in multiple environments.','Strongly egalitarian implications; can  be interpreted as spatially extensive beneficence.','Actors and entities requiring care.','Humanity, care givers.','Patriarchal and parochial actors either opposed to values of caring or imposing their own conceptions of what constitutes care.','The activity of care, centering on moral development around the understanding of responsibility and relationships (Tronto, 1993, p.78).

Security labels range from the most sensitive (e.g., \"Top Secret\"), down to the least sensitive (e.g., \"Unclassified\" or \"Public\").
