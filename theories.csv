Power is discussed in terms of 'maintaining the state', and legitimate rights of rulership adds nothing to the actual possession of power, and should be excluded from political decision-making and judgement.

Fortune is a malevolent and uncompromising fount of human misery, affliction, and disaster. His analogy for fortune is with a destructive river: ''She shows her power where virtu and wisdom do not prepare to resist her, and directs her fury where she knows that no dykes or embankments are ready to hold her'' (Machiavelli 1965, 90); ''it is better to be impetuous than cautious, because Fortuna is a woman and it is necessary, in order to keep her under, to beat and maul her'' (Machiavelli 1965, 92).","One of the strengths of game theory is that its formal structure facilitates the identification of inconsistent assumptions, highlights the implications of initial assumptions, and increases the probability of logical argumentation.","Sudden, outright, forceful, and vicious acts carried out by organs of the state; 'divide and rule'.","Authority of states and their laws will never be acknowledged when they are not supported by a show of power which renders obedience inescapable.

Yet Thucydides never calls in question the intrinsic superiority of nobility to baseness, a superiority that shines forth particularly when the noble is destroyed by the base. Therefore Thucydides' History arouses in the reader a sadness which is never aroused by Machiavelli's books. In Machiavelli we find comedies, parodies, and satires but nothing reminding of tragedy.

Rousseau: Progressive civil society is primarily founded on property and ownership underwritten by a social contract. Locke:  All are free to do as they wish within the law of nature and of reason.,"Hobbes argued that all humans are by nature equal in faculties of body and mind (i.e., no natural inequalities are so great as to give anyone a ""claim"" to an exclusive ""benefit""). From this equality and other causes in human nature, everyone is naturally willing to fight one another: so that ""during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called warre; and such a warre as is of every man against every man"". In this state every person has a natural right or liberty to do anything one thinks necessary for preserving one's own life; and life is ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"" (Leviathan, Chapters XIII_XIV). ""The war of all against all"" (Latin: Bellum omnium contra omnes, in De Cive, 1642). A thought experiment about human existence in the state of nature: 'I demonstrate, in the first place, that the state of men without civil society (which state we may properly call the state of nature) is nothing else but a mere war of all against all; and in that war all men have equal right unto all things.' Hobbes suggests that people choose to enter a social contract, giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy peace. This thought experiment is a test for the legitimation of a state in fulfilling its role as 'sovereign' to guarantee social order, and for comparing different types of states on that basis.","state of nature, liberalism, liberal, rule of law, law, peace, state (Referent), equal, fight, power, war, preserving, civil society, nature, social contract, peace, state, sovereignty, order, rights, anarchy, right, state, materialism, negotiation, civil union, military (Agent), state (Threat), law, reason, punishment, sanctions, dissociation, state (Referent), individuals, human rights, threat, Hobbes (Primary Source), Rousseau (Primary Source), Locke (Primary Source)","Societies cannot survive without a strong central government to serve and protect all, acting only with the ""consent of the governed.""

Norms, identity and ideas generally are central to the constitution and dynamics of world politics. 'Securitisation' and 'securitisation moves', 'existential threat' to a particular referent object and this move is accepted by a relevant audience. Security, in this sense, is a site of negotiation between speakers and audiences, albeit one conditioned significantly by the extent to which the speaker enjoys a position of authority within a particular group: 'only from a specific place, in an institutional voice, by elites' Weaver (1995: 57). Regarding referent objects: 'at the heart of the (security) concept we still find something to do with defence and the state' (Weaver 1995: 47).

This view is most neatly captured in Alexander Wendt's seminal 1992 article, 'Anarchy is What States Make of it'. This meaning is not (and cannot be) a simple reflection of an external material reality, but is developed through intersubjective interaction in the international system; several particular cultures of anarchy, rather than a timeless reality. The security dilemma is not inevitable, but is itself a social construction.","Security is a site of negotiation (between political leaders and domestic audiences in particular) and contestation (between different actors elaborating different visions of 'our' values and how 'we' should act). 'Regional security complex': a set of units in a particular geographical area whose security processes and dynamics are interlinked to the extent that their security problems need to be understood or addressed in conjunction with each other. Security complexes are defined in terms of mutually exclusive geographic regions, with Regions and Powers focusing on security interaction and dynamics in Europe, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East and Africa (Buzan et al. 1998: 201, Buzan and Weaver 2003: 44).","The state, and other groups if desired, but the state is priveleged in the framework. Generally encourages different definitions of referent object.","Agents and structures are mutually constituted; state political leaders designate other states as 'friend' or 'enemy' - and approach them as such - on the basis of conceptions of identity (see Hopf, 1998). Critical constructivists look at 'how possible' questions: 'how meanings are produced and attached to various social subjects/objects, thus constituting particular interpretive dispositions which create certain possibilities and preclude others' (Doty 1993: 298).",Any actor that is said to represent an `existential threat' to the referent.,"The designation of threat occurring because of theadoption of a particular perspective on security: conceptions of who we are and what we value encourage particular ways of thinking.","Associated with the development of norms for global governance and the role of ideational factors in world politics generally; commitment to avoiding universal and abstract analytical definitions of security. Weaver (1995: 56-57) expressed normative preference for desecuritization: the removal of issues from the security agenda; invoking the concept of security is seen as a discursive process that erases all rules of normal politics, requiring care in its use.","Securitization: from originally positioning the speech act itself as securitization, by 1998 these 'speech acts' were defined as securitizing moves, with an 'issue securitized only if and when the audience accepts it as such' (Buzan et al. 1998: 25). Facilitating conditions: particular contexts (including the form of the speech act; position of the speaker; and historical conditions associated with threat) that enable the acceptance of a particular securitizing move by the relevant audience. Constructivist approaches are able to come to terms with periods of structural change enabled by strategic actors in world politics; most prominently the end of the Cold War.","Nicholas Onuf, World of Our Making.",1989,"Lene Hansen (2000) suggests that the Copenhagen School's ultimate focus on 'dominant voices' contributes to further silencing those already marginalized from security debates. The Copenhagen School's expressed preference for desecuritization - the removal of issues from the realm of security - is a product of a narrow view of the logic of security that has important normative implications. In their framework, a further area of bias is arguably that towards the 'West', and ultimately neoliberal democratic forms of government. Also, the role of audience reception remains underdeveloped.
